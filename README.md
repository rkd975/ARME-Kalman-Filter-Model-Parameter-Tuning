# ARME-Kalman-Filter-Model-Parameter-Tuning
- Code for optimising parameters for both artificial and real data (files beginning with RD_... were written/edited by me)
- Best ran in Google Colab (RD_optreal_results will **only run in Colab**) or in a Jupyter Notebook (with pandas library)
- All code in python

## Running RD_optreal_results: 
- Must run in Google Colab
- Need to **manually upload virtuoso.csv** into a prompt once you click *run* on the first cell block
